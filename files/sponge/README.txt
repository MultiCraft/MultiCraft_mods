MultiCraft Game mod: sponge
===========================
See license.txt for license information.

Wet sponges are quite rare, found deep in the sea where it is dark (below -11).
These can be cooked into dry sponges, and then placed near a liquid to remove an area of it. They will hold the water away until they are removed.
They turn in to wet sponges when used, so to use them again, they have to be cooked.
