MultiCraft Game mod: bonemeal
=============================
See license.txt for license information.

This mod adds four new items into the game, bones which can be dug from normal
dirt which can be made into bonemeal, mulch which is is crafted using a tree and
8x leaves, and fertiliser which is a mixture of them both.

Each item can be used on saplings and crops for a chance to grow them quicker as
well as dirt which will generate random grass, flowers or whichever decoration
is registered.
